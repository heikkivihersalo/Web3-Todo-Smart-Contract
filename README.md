# Web3-Todo-Smart-Contract

This smart contract is to demonstrate a simple todo app idea. It has methods to add, fetch and mark todos as done or undone. Simplest way to test the contract is to use Remix Builder (https://remix.ethereum.org/). Contract can be further developed as an application with front-end control.

1. Open https://remix.ethereum.org/
2. Create a new file with the content of "ToDoApp.sol"
3. Go to Compiler and compile file
4. Deploy the contract for example with Javascript VM
5. Congratulations! You are now ready to add todos to blockchain (well virtually for demo purposes).
